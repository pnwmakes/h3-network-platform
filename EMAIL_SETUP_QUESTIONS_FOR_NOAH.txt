## IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS BASED ON ANSWERS

Once you provide these answers, I can:
1. Set up the chosen email service integration
2. Create the newsletter database model
3. Build the subscription API endpoints
4. Design email templates matching H3 Network branding
5. Implement admin tools for newsletter management
6. Test the complete subscription flow

## DEVELOPMENT PRIORITY

If email setup takes longer than expected, I can proceed with the like/share functionality first and implement the newsletter system once we have the email service details sorted out.

Please provide answers to as many questions as possible so we can move forward with implementation this week.
